# Notes

## Delegates and Lambdas
* Delegate is a typed definition for a function like a class for an object. A class declares a type, the object is the instance of that type. Same way delegates are just type, they define a common set of functions. All the functions who looks exactly like a delgate, they all are called the instances of the delegate

* A delgate is a typed definition and all the funciton who share the same type of parameters and retrun value, they fulfill the contract of the delegage. The are compatinble with this delegate.

* The benefit of delegate is to help writing a generic function which know how to do an exection but not which execution. so it provides a generic way of what a function does

* A lambda function is just a delegate, a function with less code i:e less letter and digits, In lambda funciton a fat arrow is a symbol to write code quickly with less words

## Generics
* Generics enable to pass in a type to a funciton like a parameter to a funciton, So a Generic delegate is just a function where not only the value parameters are parameter but also the type of a parameters are parameter, we call it typed paramters
